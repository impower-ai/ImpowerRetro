**Simple Design Principles:**
- **No external configuration files** - All settings are compile-time constants
- **Memory-only storage** - No database or file persistence required
- **Service-based architecture** - Clean separation of concerns

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` - Development/Production
- `ASPNETCORE_URLS` - Binding URLs
- `IR_TEMPLATES` - Custom session templates (JSON format, optional)

### Session Templates

**Default Templates:**
Templates are built-in and defined in `Components/Utilities/Constants.cs`. The four available templates (Default, MSG, Sailboat, 4Ls) are designed to cover most retrospective scenarios.

**Custom Templates:**
You can override the default templates by setting the `IR_TEMPLATES` environment variable with JSON:

```bash
# Example: Add a custom "DACI" template
'[
  {
    "Name": "DACI",
    "Columns": ["Driver", "Approver", "Contributors", "Informed"]
  },
  {
    "Name": "Start Stop Continue",
    "Columns": ["Start", "Stop", "Continue"]
  }
]'
```

**Railway Deployment:**
In Railway dashboard, add the environment variable:
- **Key:** `IR_TEMPLATES`
- **Value:** Your JSON template definition

If the environment variable is invalid or empty, the application falls back to the built-in default templates.

## Deployment

### Railway (Recommended)

Deploy ImpowerRetro to Railway with one click:

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/deploy/LZBVj9?referralCode=6X4KFq)

The template automatically sets up:
- The ImpowerRetro web application
- All required environment variables
- HTTPS with automatic certificates

### Manual Deployment

```bash
dotnet publish -c Release -o publish
# Copy publish folder to your server
```

## Development

### Code Style

- **Naming**: PascalCase for public members, camelCase with underscore for private fields
- **File Organization**: Partial classes separate UI from logic
- **Error Handling**: ServiceResult pattern with graceful degradation
- **Documentation**: Minimal comments focused on non-obvious aspects

## Privacy & Security Model

ImpowerRetro is designed for **transparent team collaboration**. Here's our privacy approach:

### **Transparency by Design**
- **Visible Contributions** - Team members can see who contributed what for effective follow-up discussions
- **Facilitator Oversight** - Session owners can manage participation and guide conversations
- **Open Collaboration** - Designed for teams that benefit from knowing contributors for accountability

### **Data Protection & Lifecycle**
- **No Data Persistence** - Sessions are stored in memory only and deleted when inactive
- **Automatic Cleanup** - All session data expires and is permanently removed after use
- **Minimal Data Collection** - Only usernames and retrospective content are collected
- **No Registration Required** - No accounts, emails, or personal information stored
- **Client-side Preferences** - User settings stored only in browser localStorage
- **HTTPS Required** - Secure communication in production environments

**Session Data Flow:**
1. **Session Creation** ‚Üí Data exists only in server memory
2. **Active Session** ‚Üí Real-time collaboration with visible usernames  
3. **Session End** ‚Üí Optional HTML export, then permanent deletion
4. **No Retention** ‚Üí Zero data storage after session completion
